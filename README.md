# 🚗 Smart Parking System

This project is an **IoT-based Smart Parking System** built using Arduino.  
It helps detect available parking spaces automatically and makes parking more efficient.

---

## 📌 Features
- Detects whether a parking slot is occupied or free
- Uses sensors (e.g., IR/Ultrasonic) for vehicle detection
- RFID integration for access control (optional)
- Displays parking status on serial monitor / LCD
- Easily expandable for multiple slots

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., UNO/Nano)
- Ultrasonic sensor(s) or IR sensor(s)
- RFID module (optional)
- Buzzer / LED indicators
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- Power supply
